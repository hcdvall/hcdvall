"I don't know who you are. 
I don't know what you want. 
If you're seeking digital riches or chaos, I can assure you, I don't hold vast wealth, but what I do possess is a highly specialized array of skills. 
Skills I've cultivated over an extensive career in computer science, machine learning, and game programming. 
These are skills that make me a formidable adversary for individuals like you in the digital realm. 
If you release your hold on the virtual world now, that'll be the end of it. 
I won't hunt you down; I won't initiate a pursuit. 
However, should you choose to persist, rest assured that I will track you, I will locate you, and I will ensure the termination of your digital endeavors."

"I don't know who you are. 
I don't know what you want. 
If you are looking for a niche skill I can tell you I don't have it, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. 
Skills I have acquired over a very long career. 
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. 
If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. 
I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you."
